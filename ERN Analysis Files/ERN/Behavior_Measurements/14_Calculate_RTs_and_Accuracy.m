%Script #14
%Operates on individual subject data
%Uses the outputs from Script #5: Elist_Bin_Epoch.m and Script #6: Artifact_Rejection.m
%This script loads the semi-continuous ICA-corrected EEG data file from Script #5 (prior to artifact rejection) and the epoched, artifact rejected EEG data file from Script #6,
%transfers the Event List from the artifact rejected file (containing information about which trials are marked for artifact rejection) to the non-artifact rejected semi-continuous EEG data file, 
%assigns events to bins for correct and incorrect response trials separately for all trials and for only the non-artifact rejected trials, extracts the mean reaction time (RT) data, 
%trial counts, and accuracy per condition for each subject, and saves the behavioral data for all subjects to a .csv file in the Behavior Measurements folder.

%Location of the main study directory
%This method of specifying the study directory only works if you run the script; for running individual lines of code, replace the study directory with the path on your computer, e.g.:

%Location of the folder that contains this script and any associated processing files
%This method of specifying the current file path only works if you run the script; for running individual lines of code, replace the current file path with the path on your computer, e.g.:
